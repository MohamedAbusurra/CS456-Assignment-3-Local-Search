8 Queens Puzzle problem solution code

Implemented Algorithms

    -- Hill Climbing Search Algorithm
        -- Uses random with seed for tie-breakers on possible successor 
        states.
        -- Program stops once heuristic = 0 for the current solution state 
        (no queens can attack each other).
        -- Prints step number, solution state board configuration, and 
        heuristic value in each iteration.

    -- Simulated Annealing Search Algorithm
        -- Uses probabilistic acceptance.
        -- Randomness is controlled by seed to reproduce results.
        -- Initial temperature = 100
        -- Cooling rate = 0.95
        -- Executes for up to 99 iterations (00-99), stopping early 
        if heuristic = 0 or temperature approaches 0, printing "Solved" 
        before terminating.
        -- Prints step number, solution state board configuration, and 
        temperature in each iteration.

Core Ideas

    -- The heuristic function is calculated by counting the pairs of 
    queens that can attack each other.
    -- The same heuristic function is used by both algorithms.
    -- Queens can only move vertically along their column when generating
    neighbor states.
    -- The Hill Climbing Search Algorithm moves to the neighbor state with
    the lowest heuristic function.
    -- The Simulated Annealing Search Algorithm allows moves to higher heuristic 
    function neighbor states with decreasing probability as temperature cools.

Input

    -- board: Eight character string of numbers (for example: 23142631).
            - Index: column where the queen is located.
            - Value of index (0–7): queen’s position in that column.
    -- seed: Integer to allow for control of randomization for reproducing results.
